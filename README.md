# ScheduleBuilder
An application that scrapes data off La Tech's Boss page, and builds desired schedules for students

When prompted desired classes for a specific quarter, the ScheduleBuilder will scrape the offered classes off of Boss. Each offered class is then compared, and schedules are built based off time compatability.
